## Definition:

A wolf is a fierce, meat-eating animal that is similar to a wild dog.

* Wolves usually hunt in groups and stalk their prey in a clever and stealthy manner.
* In the Bible, the term "wolves" is used figuratively to refer to false teachers or false prophets who destroy believers, who are compared to sheep. False teaching causes people to believe wrong things that bring harm to them.
* This comparison is based on the fact that sheep are especially vulnerable to being attacked and eaten by wolves, because they are weak and cannot defend themselves.

## Translation Suggestion

* This term could be translated as "wild dog" or "wild animal."
* Other names for wild dogs could be "jackal" or "coyote."
* When used figuratively to refer to people, this could be translated as "evil people who harm people like animals that attack sheep."
