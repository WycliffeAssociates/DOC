## Definitions:

In the Bible, the phrase "wise men" often refers to men who serve God and act wisely, not foolishly. The term "wise men" or "educated men" is also a special term that refers to men with unusual knowledge and abilities who served as part of a king's court.

* Sometimes the term "wise men" is explained in the text as "prudent men" or "men with understanding." This refers to men who act wisely and righteously because they obey God.
* The "wise men" or "educated men" who served pharaohs and other kings were often scholars who studied the stars, especially looking for special meanings for the patterns that the stars made in their positions in the sky.
* Often the "wise men" or "educated men" were expected to explain the meanings of dreams. For example, King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his wise men describe his dreams and tell him what they meant, but none of them was able to do this, except Daniel, who received this knowledge from God.
* Sometimes the "wise men" or "educated men" performed magical acts such as divination or miracles that were done through the power of evil spirits.

Translation Suggestions:

* When "wise men" simply refers to men who act wisely, the word "wise" should be translated in the same or similar way to how it is translated elsewhere in the Bible.
* When "wise men" refers to men who have an important job working for a ruler, it could be translated as "wise men" or "educated men" or some other term that refers to such a job, such as "advisor."
