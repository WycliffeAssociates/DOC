# hour (biblical time)

## Definition:

The term "hour" is often used in the Bible to tell what time of day a certain event took place. It is also used figuratively to mean "moment," "a while" or "time".

* The Jews counted daylight hours starting at sunrise (around 6 a.m.). For example, "the ninth hour" meant "around three in the afternoon."
* Nighttime hours were counted starting at sunset (around 6 p.m.). For example, "the third hour of the night" meant "around nine in the evening" in our present-day system.
* Sometimes "hour" refers to a regular, scheduled time to do something, such as the "hour of prayer."

## Translation Suggestions:

* Since references to time in the Bible will not correspond exactly to the present-day time system, phrases such as "around nine" or "about six o'clock" could be used.
* Some translations might add phrases like "in the evening" or "in the morning" or "in the afternoon" to make it clear what time of day is being talked about.
* The phrase, "in that hour" could be translated as, "at that time" or "in that moment."
