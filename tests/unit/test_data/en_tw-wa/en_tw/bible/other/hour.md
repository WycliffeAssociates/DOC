# hour

## Definition:

In addition to being used to refer to when or how long something took place, the term "hour" is also used in several figurative ways:

* When the text says that the "hour had come" for Jesus to suffer and be put to death, this means that it was the appointed time for this to happenâ€”the time that God had selected long ago.
* The phrase "that hour" is also used to mean "at that moment" or "right then."
* When the text talks about the "hour" being late, this means that it was late in the day, when the sun would soon be setting.

* The expression "the hour was late" could be translated as "it was late in the day" or "it would soon be getting dark" or "it was late afternoon."
