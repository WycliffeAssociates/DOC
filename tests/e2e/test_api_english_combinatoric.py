# This will build a PDF for every book of the bible for English, thus
# it takes a long time. This makes it unpleasant to run all tests via
# the 'make e2e-tests' Makefile target. Note that English tests exist
# in additional places so you aren't not testing English resources by
# skipping this. This is just additional coverage that could be run
# once in a while.
