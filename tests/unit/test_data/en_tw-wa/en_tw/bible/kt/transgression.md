* The terms "transgression," "sin," "iniquity," and "trespass" all include the meaning of acting against God's will and disobeying his commands.
* To "offend" someone is to anger him by transgressing against him. He will then be "offended."

* If a verse or passage uses two terms that mean "sin" or "transgress" or "trespass," it is important, if possible, to use different ways to translate these terms. When the Bible uses two or more terms with similar meanings in the same context, usually its purpose is to emphasize what is being said or to show its importance.
