# Introduction to Translation Words

Translation Words is a basic Bible dictionary that provides translators with clear definitions and translation suggestions for important words in the Unlocked Literal Bible and in the Open Bible Stories. It provides translators and checkers with essential information to help them make the best possible translation decisions.

Translation Words has entries for important concepts, people, and places in the Bible. It also contains entries for things that some people today might not be well familiar with, such as certain kinds of roles, animals, or objects that the people in the Bible knew about.

The Translation Words presented in the Translation Resources PDFs for each book of the Bible include only those words that appear in that book. Because of this, some of the links in the PDFs to other words do not work.

**You can learn more about Translation Words** in the Appendix to the Translation Words [[rc://en_tw/00-About_tW/tW-3-Appendix.md]]. It has the following sections:
* Decisions Concerning Translation Words
* Format of Translation Word Entries
* How to use Translation Words
* Dealing with Unknown Ideas
* Contributors to Translation Words (Fuller List)
