# water

## Definition:

In addition to its primary meaning, "water" also often refers to a body of water, such as an ocean, sea, lake, or river.

* The term "waters" refers to bodies of water or many sources of water. 
* The term "waters" can also be a general reference to a large amount of water.
* To "water" livestock and other animals means to provide water for them. In Bible times, this usually involved drawing water from a well with a bucket and pouring the water into a trough or other container for the animals to drink from.
* The phrase "draw water" means "pull water up from a well with a bucket."

## Translation Suggestions:

* "Streams of living water will flow from them" could be translated as "the power and blessings from the Holy Spirit will flow out of them them like streams of water." Instead of "blessings" the term "gifts" or "fruits" or "godly character" could be used.
* When Jesus is talking to the Samaritan woman at the well, the phrase "living water" could be translated as "water that gives life" or "lifegiving water." In this context, the imagery of water must be kept in the translation.
* Depending on the context, the term "waters" or "many waters" could be translated as "great suffering (that surrounds you like water)" or "overwhelming difficulties (like a flood of water)" or "large amounts of water."
