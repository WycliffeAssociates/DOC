# horseman

## Definition:

In Bible times, the term "horsemen" referred to men who rode horses into battle.

* Warriors who rode in horse-pulled chariots may also have been called "horsemen," though this term usually refers to men who were actually riding on horses.
* The Israelites believed that using horses in battle placed too much emphasis on their own strength rather than on Yahweh, so they did not have many horsemen.
* This term could also be translated as "horse riders" or "men on horses."
