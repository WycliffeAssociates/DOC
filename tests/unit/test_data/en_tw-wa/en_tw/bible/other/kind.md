# kind

## Definition:

The terms "kind" and "kinds" refer to groups or classifications of things that are connected by shared characteristics.

* In the Bible, this term is specifically used to refer to the distinctive kinds of plants and animals that God made when he created the world.
* Often there are many different variations or species within each "kind." For example, horses, zebras, and donkeys are all members of the same "kind," but they are different species.
* The main thing that distinguishes each "kind" as a separate group is that members of that group can reproduce more of their same "kind." Members of different kinds cannot do that with each other.
