## Definition:

When used figuratively in the Bible, "clothed with" means to be endowed or equipped with something. To "clothe" oneself with something means to seek to have a certain character quality.

* In the same way that clothing is outside your body and is visible to all, when you are "clothed" with a certain character quality, others can readily see it. To "clothe yourself with kindness" means to let your actions be so characterized by kindness that it is easily seen by everyone.
* To be "clothed with power from on high" means to have power given to you.
* This term is also used to express negative experiences, such as "clothed with shame" or "clothed with terror."
* All of the clothes a person wears is called his "wardrobe."

## Translation Suggestions:

* If possible, it is best to keep the literal figure of speech, "clothe yourselves with." Another way to translate this could be "put on" if this refers to putting on clothes.
* If that does not give the correct meaning, other ways to translate "clothed with" could be "showing" or "manifesting" or "filled with" or "having the quality of."
* The term "clothe yourself with" could also be translated as "cover yourself with" or "behave in a way that shows."
