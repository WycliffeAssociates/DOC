# Salt Sea

## Facts:

The Salt Sea (also called the Dead Sea) is a lake in the Jordan River Valley. The Jordan River flows into the sea.

* In Bible times, Israel was west of the sea, and Moab was east of the sea.
* Because it is smaller than most seas, it could be called "Salt Lake."
* This sea has such a high concentration of minerals (or "salts") that nothing can live in its waters. Its lack of plants and animals is the cause of the name "Dead Sea."
* In the Old Testament, this sea is also called the "Sea of Arabah" and the "Sea of Negev" because of its location near the regions of Arabah and Negev.
