# reed

## Definitions:

The term "reed" refers to a plant with a long stalk that grows in the water, usually along the edge of a river or stream.

* The reeds in the Nile River where Moses was hidden as a baby were also called "bulrushes." They were tall, hollow stalks growing in dense clumps in the river water.
* These fibrous plants were used in ancient Egypt for making paper, baskets, and boats.
* The stalk of the reed plant is flexible and is easily bent over by the wind.
