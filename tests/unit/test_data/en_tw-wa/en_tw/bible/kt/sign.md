## Definition:

A sign is an object, event, or action that communicates a special meaning.

* "Reminders" are signs that "remind" people by helping them remember something, often something that was promised:

 * The rainbows God creates in the sky are signs to remind people that he has promised he will never again destroy all life with a worldwide flood.
 * God commanded the Israelites to circumcise their sons as a sign of his covenant with them.

* Signs can reveal or point to something:

 * An angel gave shepherds a sign that would help them know which baby in Bethlehem was the newborn Messiah.
 * Judas kissed Jesus as a sign to the religious leaders that Jesus was the one they should arrest.

* Signs can prove that something is true:
 * The miracles performed by the prophets and apostles were signs that proved they were speaking God's message.
 * The miracles that Jesus performed were signs that proved he was truly the Messiah.

* A "signal flag" is a flag that a king would raise as a sign so that people could see it and come to him or go into battle.
* An "omen" is an event that people think tells that something else will happen in the future.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Depending on its context, "sign" could also be translated as "signal" or "symbol" or "mark" or "evidence" or "proof" or "gesture."
* To "make signs with the hands" could also be translated as "motion with the hands" or "gesture with the hands" or "make gestures."
